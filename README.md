## What it is:
Hobby project to create a UAV (Unmanned aerial vehicle) in a quadcopter drone format, based on the OSD32MP1 SiP which is a Linux capable system.

## Block diagram

The system block diagram is still a work in progress.
Still looking for a good option on ESC (electronic speed controller) for the drone. Maybe CAN bus based systems can be used as there is a CAN bus available in the OSD32MP1 SiP.
